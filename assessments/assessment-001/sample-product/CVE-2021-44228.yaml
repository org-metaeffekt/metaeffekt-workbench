history:
  - status: applicable
    rationale: "<p>Vulnerability applicable. Upgrade to latest version on Log4j (2.17.2) pending.</p>
      <p>The modified CVSS vectors anticipate that - in the given context - currently no possibility was identified to
      inject a log message with malicious content and the complexity for an attacker is high (TD:M; MAC:H).
      The modification is however not sufficient to reduce the severity. Therefore, the upgrade to a newer version or
      removal of Log4j is imperative to address the vulnerability.</p>"
    date: "2023-03-02"
    risk: "Direct or indirect injection of messages may result in execution of arbitrary code."
    measures: "<p>
       <lq>
          <b>Fix:</b> Upgrade to latest version of Log4j mandatory.
       </lq>
      </p>
      <p>
       <lq>
          <b>Mitigation:</b> Eliminate all external options to inject foreign log messages.
