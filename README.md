# {metaeffekt} Workbench

The metaeffekt workbench repository contains a sample workbench illustrating the integration and use of the
[metaeffekt-kontinuum](https://github.com/org-metaeffekt/metaeffekt-kontinuum). The repository is supposed to serve
as a reference and guide for custom workbench implementations. The workbench is part of a broader set of projects consisting
of the workbench itself, the [metaeffekt-kontinuum](https://github.com/org-metaeffekt/metaeffekt-kontinuum) and the
metaeffekt-workspace. In conjunction these projects enable a user to utilize the entire suite of tools, plugins and content
provided by {metaeffekt}.
