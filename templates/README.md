# Templates

In this folder documentation templates are maintained. The templates contained in this directory represent a cut-down
selection of the templates found in our metaeffekt-workbench project as not all reference templates are needed here.
Depending on which report type was triggered, a fitting profile is selected which generates the relevant report sections into a single resulting pdf.


## Profiles

### Software Distribution Annex (SDA)

### License Documentation (LD)

### Initial License Documentation (ILD)

### Vulnerability Report (VR)

### CERT Report (CR)

TODO
