            <p id="vulnerabilities">
                The vulnerabilities enlisted within this document are primarily vulnerabilities of third-party software
                or hardware components that are included within or integrated with assets of ${organization.name}. The
                fact that such a component is affected by a known vulnerability must not necessarily imply that
                assets are affected. To determine the relevance and potential risks, vulnerabilities are categorized and
                assessed within the context of the assets using or integrating the components.

            <title>Vulnerability Assessment Categories</title>
            <p id="categories">
                This report organizes vulnerabilities in three assessment categories:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Affected</b> - This category covers vulnerabilities that
                      have been assessed were identified as vulnerabilities affecting one or
                      more assets in scope.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Potentially Affected</b> - Vulnerabilities that have not
                      yet been assessed are considered to potentially affect one or
                      more assets in scope.
                    </li>

                    <li><b>Not Affected</b> - In case a vulnerability does not have any
                     	impact on the assets in scope, the vulnerability is categorized to
                     	not affect the assets.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                These categorizes are used specifically in statistics and summaries.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Vulnerability Assessment Status</title>
            <p id="status">
            	On the individual level of a vulnerability in a specific usage, integration and deployment
            	context the vulnerability assessment status can be determined:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Applicable</b> - A vulnerability is found to be included and to be potentially
                        exploitable in the scope of an asset. In particular, no justification can
                        be provided arguing that the vulnerability cannot be exploited.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Not Applicable</b> - A vulnerability is considered not applicable
                        in case evidence can be provided, constituting the vulnerability either as
                        not accessible or as not reachable in the context of an asset. Especially,
                        vulnerabilities in functions or interfaces not in use or deactivated are
                        considered not applicable.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Insignificant</b> - A vulnerability is regarded as insignificant
                        in case the original severity does not exceed a predetermined
                        score or a vulnerability has been assessed and is explicitly marked
                        as insignificant in the given context. The status supports to
                        prioritize assessments, while providing a comprehensive view.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Void</b> - Void vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that have been reported and assessed
                        for other versions of the assets considered in scope. Void vulnerabilities affect
                        component versions that are not included in the current asset version. The affected components
                        have either been patched or are not included in the currently provided assets.
                        Void vulnerabilities are reported to provide continuity over a product's life cycle.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>In Review</b> - A vulnerability is in review in case
                        assessment details are insufficient or not available.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <title>Vulnerability Remediation</title>
            <p id="remediation">
                Vulnerability assessment is performed to remediate vulnerabilities. During an assessment
                it is possible to capture a rationale to justify the assessment
                status and to further assessment details. In particular:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    	Modification to the severity score (i.e. including context information) can be applied.
                    </li>
                	<li>
                        Identified risks can be captured and disclosed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    	Measures can be concluded to mitigate risk.
                    </li>

            <title>Vulnerability Severity Metrics</title>
            <p id="scoring">
                Generally, vulnerability severity is measured using the <abbreviated-form keyref="cvss"/> scoring system.
                Currently, two versions of the CVSS scoring system are commonly applied and supported by the NVD. This
                document uses both the CVSS version 2.0 and the CVSS versions 3.x.
            </p>
            <p id="scoring-metrics">
                In case a CVSS version 3.x vector is available all severity metrics are using this version. If
                no CVSS version 3.x vector is provided for a vulnerability, the severity metrics fall back to a CVSS
                version 2.0 vector, if available. The resulting metrics are used for computing scores, severity
                categorization, ordering and charting.
            </p>
            <p id="scoring-backgrounds">
                This approach is taken since CVSS version 3.x allows more fine-granular and therefore more
                differentiated assessments.

            <title>Vulnerability Prioritization</title>
            <p>
                The Vulnerability Priority Score automates the ranking of vulnerabilities based on their relevance
                within a specific context.
                The score is computed based on the contextualized CVSS score as a base score with additional
                metrics applied. These additional metrics are detailed in the priority sections of the vulnerability
                details chapters. A priority label is derived for each vulnerability indicating whether - due to an
               increased Priority Score - a timely treatment is due.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Priority Score is a non-normalized, non-continuous metric. It is not capped in order to
                provide a relative measurement for ranking vulnerabilities applying a policy-driven prioritization.

                The <abbreviated-form keyref="nvd" /> is the primary data source for vulnerability information utilized. A vulnerable
                product is represented within NVD as <abbreviated-form keyref="cpe" />; an individual vulnerability as
                <abbreviated-form keyref="cve" />.
            </p>
            <p>
                Advisory information is included from additional sources. These vary dependent on the product domain and target
                audience.
