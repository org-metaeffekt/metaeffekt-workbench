# TODO

## General

* [ ] ensure all schema files are available on metaeffekt.com; we must not use local checked-in schema files
* [ ] insert license header on code files

## Processors

* [x] move ae-workbench-parent.xml to a dedicated folder (the current location is too prominent)

## Folder descriptors

* [ ] List supported / covered descriptors
* [ ] describe purpose for each descriptor
* [ ] add comments to descriptor files if further explanation is required.
* [ ] refer to metaeffekt documentation for further details

## Correlations

* [ ] support multiple (at least two) correlation folders to enable combinatorics. Perhaps via glob include pattern.
